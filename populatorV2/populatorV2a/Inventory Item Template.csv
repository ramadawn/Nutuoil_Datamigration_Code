Reorder point = [(average lead time days + safety stock days) * demand]
With safety stock quantity defined: 
Reorder point = [(average lead time days * demand) + safety stock quantity)

The Cost Estimate Type determines what value NetSuite uses to calculate estimated Gross Profit. 

The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction. 

The individual line items that you enter in a transaction determine the amounts that post in NetSuite when you process that transaction.
 
The following Cost Estimate Types on Items are available: 
Item Defined Cost - a user-defined amount, entered into the Item Defined Cost field on the Item definition page.
Average Cost - NetSuite calculates an average cost of the units purchased. With Multi-Location Inventory enabled, NetSuite calculates the average across all locations. Otherwise, the average calculation uses location-specific costs.
Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. If you make multiple purchases on the same day that use different rates, this field shows the highest purchase price on that day, per location if applicable. When you use the Multiple-Location Inventory feature, the last purchase price reflects the most recent receipt at any location. If you track Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), NetSuite identifies the cost of the item based on your COGS settings.
Purchase Price - Enter the price that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.

Purchase Order Rate - Initially uses the Preferred Vendor Rate cost, and then after a purchase order is entered, this type uses the most recent actual purchase order rate. Special orders and drop-shipped items use this cost information.
Derived from Member Items - Total costs of items currently included in a kit. This Cost Estimate Type only applies to kits and sums the estimated costs of each item in the kit, based on each of their individual Cost Estimate Types. Uses the latest definition of the kit, not its historical definition. ","SALES/PRICING
